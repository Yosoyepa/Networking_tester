## Phase 2 Objectives

**"Integrate ML feature extraction and QoS anomaly inference as scalable services. Introduce dedicated data stores."**

### âœ… Phase 1 Foundation - COMPLETE
- All 6 core distributed services operational
- RabbitMQ message queue infrastructure validated  
- Core pipeline data flow established
- Robust error handling and test coverage

---

## Phase 2 Task Breakdown

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.1: Enhanced Feature Extractor Service âœ… **AVAILABLE**
- **Deliverable:** Service operational with `src/ai_monitoring/feature_extractor.py` logic adapted
- **Status:** **READY** - Enhanced service already implemented in `enhanced_feature_extractor_service.py`
- **Integration:** Enhance current basic service with model-aware capabilities

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.2: Advanced QoS ML Inference Service âœ… **AVAILABLE**  
- **Deliverable:** Enhanced ML inference with robust feature mismatch handling
- **Status:** **READY** - Enhanced service available in `qos_ml_inference_service.py`
- **Integration:** Replace basic inference with enhanced multi-model support

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.3: ML Model Registry Implementation ðŸ”§ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Deliverable:** Simple model store for versioning and accessing ML models
- **Status:** **STARTING** - Basic registry exists, needs enhancement
- **Goal:** Robust model management with versioning and metadata

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.4: Core Analysis & Aggregation Service Enhancement ðŸ”§ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Deliverable:** Service stores comprehensive analysis data in dedicated data store
- **Status:** **ENHANCEMENT** - Current service needs data store integration
- **Goal:** Add Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL for processed data storage

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.5: Enhanced Reporting Service ðŸ”§ **PLANNED**
- **Deliverable:** Query processed data store and generate advanced reports
- **Status:** **PLANNED** - Current service needs data store integration
- **Goal:** Rich reporting from centralized data store

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2.6: Service Containerization ðŸ”§ **PLANNED**
- **Deliverable:** Dockerfiles for all services + Docker Compose orchestration
- **Status:** **PLANNED** - Prepare for scalable deployment
- **Goal:** Production-ready containerized deployment

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2.1: ML Enhancement (Tasks 2.1-2.3)
1. **Deploy Enhanced Feature Extractor** - Replace basic with model-aware service
2. **Deploy Enhanced QoS ML Inference** - Multi-model support with health monitoring  
3. **Implement ML Model Registry** - Centralized model versioning and management

### Phase 2.2: Data Store Integration (Task 2.4-2.5)
1. **Deploy Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL** - Dedicated processed data storage
2. **Enhance Core Analysis Service** - Integrate with data store
3. **Enhance Reporting Service** - Query and report from data store

### Phase 2.3: Production Readiness (Task 2.6)
1. **Create Service Dockerfiles** - Containerize all services
2. **Create Docker Compose** - Orchestrated deployment
3. **Production Testing** - Validate scaled deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Data Store Selection
- **Primary:** Elasticsearch (for analytics and search)
- **Secondary:** PostgreSQL (for structured data and relationships)
- **Rationale:** Elasticsearch for time-series and analytics, PostgreSQL for metadata

### Model Registry Architecture
- **Storage:** File-based with metadata manifest
- **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- **Integration:** MLflow compatibility for advanced scenarios

### Container Strategy
- **Base Images:** Python 3.11-slim for services
- **Networking:** Docker bridge network for service communication
- **Volumes:** Persistent storage for data stores and models

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Completion Metrics
- âœ… Enhanced ML services deployed and operational
- âœ… Model registry with versioning operational
- âœ… Dedicated data store integrated (Elasticsearch + PostgreSQL)
- âœ… Advanced reporting from data store
- âœ… All services containerized with Docker Compose
- âœ… End-to-end testing with enhanced pipeline

### Performance Targets
- **Throughput:** Handle 1000+ packets/second processing
- **Latency:** <100ms average ML inference time
- **Scalability:** Multiple service instances operational
- **Reliability:** 99.9% service uptime in tests

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Model Registry Complexity:** Start with simple file-based, enhance gradually
2. **Data Store Performance:** Use appropriate indices and partitioning
3. **Container Coordination:** Use Docker Compose for local dev, prepare for K8s

### Rollback Strategy
- Phase 1 services remain operational as fallback
- Enhanced services can be deployed alongside basic services
- Gradual migration with validation at each step

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. âœ… Deploy Enhanced Feature Extractor Service
2. âœ… Deploy Enhanced QoS ML Inference Service  
3. âœ… Implement ML Model Registry enhancements

### Short Term (Next Phase)
1. ðŸ”§ Deploy Elasticsearch for processed data storage
2. ðŸ”§ Enhance Core Analysis Service with data store integration
3. ðŸ”§ Create advanced reporting capabilities

### Long Term (Phase Completion)
1. ðŸ”§ Complete service containerization
2. ðŸ”§ Full end-to-end testing
3. âœ… Phase 2 completion documentation
