  - Complete message schemas defined in `src/messaging/schemas.py`
  - Validated through integration tests

#### Task 1.2: Refactor Packet Ingestor - ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Deliverable:** Packet Ingestor successfully publishes raw frames. Existing `src/capture` logic adapted.

- **Status:** ✅ DONE  
- **Implementation:**
  - `src/parsing/packet_parser_service.py` operational
  - Consumes from raw frames queue, publishes to parsed packets queue
  - IEEE 802.3 and 802.11 parsing integrated

#### Task 1.4: Develop Basic Statistics Collector Service - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Deliverable:** Service consumes parsed packets and generates aggregate statistics.
- **Status:** ✅ DONE
- **Implementation:**
  - `src/statistics/statistics_collector_service.py` operational
  - Comprehensive statistics aggregation and publishing
  - Real-time statistics reporting

#### Task 1.5: Adapt CLI for New Workflow - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Deliverable:** CLI can initiate capture/PCAP processing using new decoupled components.
- **Status:** ✅ DONE
- **Implementation:**
  - `main_distributed.py` provides distributed architecture CLI
  - Service orchestration and management capabilities
  - Integration with new workflow

#### Task 1.6: Robustness Review of Core Analyzers - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Deliverable:** Core parsers more resilient to malformed packets. Unit tests cover edge cases.
- **Status:** ✅ DONE
- **Implementation:**
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** Corrupted `feature_extractor_service.py` completely rebuilt
  - Error handling improvements across all services
  - Comprehensive integration test validation

---

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 🚨 Blocker Resolution: FeatureExtractorService Corruption
- **Issue:** `src/ai_monitoring/feature_extractor_service.py` was corrupted with multiple duplicate method definitions
- **Resolution:** Complete file recreation from scratch based on working reference
- **Impact:** Removed critical pipeline blocker, restored full Phase 1 functionality

### 🧹 Code Cleanup Completed
- **Removed redundant files:**
  - `test_simple_pipeline_old.py` 
  - `statistics_collector_service_old.py`
  - `statistics_collector_service_new.py`
  - Empty duplicate files
- **Result:** Clean, maintainable codebase ready for Phase 2

### 🔧 Integration Test Fixes
- **Fixed:** `setup_logging()` parameter compatibility in integration tests
- **Result:** All integration tests passing successfully
